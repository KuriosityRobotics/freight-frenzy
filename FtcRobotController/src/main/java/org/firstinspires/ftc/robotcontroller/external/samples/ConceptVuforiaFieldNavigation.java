/**
 * This OpMode illustrates using the Vuforia localizer to determine positioning and orientation of
 * robot on the FTC field using the RC phone's camera.  The code is structured as a LinearOpMode
 *
 * Note: If you are using a WEBCAM see ConceptVuforiaFieldNavigationWebcam.java
 *
 * When images are located, Vuforia is able to determine the position and orientation of the
 * image relative to the camera.  This sample code then combines that information with a
 * knowledge of where the target images are on the field, to determine the location of the camera.
 *
 * Finally, the location of the camera on the robot is used to determine the
 * robot's location and orientation on the field.
 *
 * To learn more about the FTC field coordinate model, see FTC_FieldCoordinateSystemDefinition.pdf in this folder
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this opmode to the Driver Station OpMode list.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: In order to use this OpMode, you need to obtain your own Vuforia license key as
 * is explained below.
