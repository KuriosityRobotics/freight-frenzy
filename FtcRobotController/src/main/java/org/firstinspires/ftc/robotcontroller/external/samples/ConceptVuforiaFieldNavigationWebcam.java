/**
 * This OpMode illustrates using the Vuforia localizer to determine positioning and orientation of
 * robot on the FTC field using a WEBCAM.  The code is structured as a LinearOpMode
 *
 * NOTE: If you are running on a Phone with a built-in camera, use the ConceptVuforiaFieldNavigation example instead of this one.
 * NOTE: It is possible to switch between multiple WebCams (eg: one for the left side and one for the right).
 *       For a related example of how to do this, see ConceptTensorFlowObjectDetectionSwitchableCameras
 *
 * When images are located, Vuforia is able to determine the position and orientation of the
 * image relative to the camera.  This sample code then combines that information with a
 * knowledge of where the target images are on the field, to determine the location of the camera.
 *
 * Finally, the location of the camera on the robot is used to determine the
 * robot's location and orientation on the field.
 *
 * To learn more about the FTC field coordinate model, see FTC_FieldCoordinateSystemDefinition.pdf in this folder
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this opmode to the Driver Station OpMode list.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: In order to use this OpMode, you need to obtain your own Vuforia license key as
 * is explained below.
